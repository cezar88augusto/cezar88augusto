## Hey! 👋

My name is Cézar Moreira, I'm brazilian and graduated in Systems analysis and Logistics.

I have been studying IT-related topics since 2018, specifically front-end and back-end. These topics have always caught my attention cause I always had curious to know how things work behind the scenes. I really enjoy solving problems and learning new things. I am always open to new challenges and ready to face changes. 

- 📍 From Minas Gerais living in BH
- 🎓 Systems Analyst
- 🎓 Logistics Analyst
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: JavaScript, NodeJs, Sql and MongoDB.
